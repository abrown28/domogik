    """ This class provides base methods for the scenario actions.
    It must not be instanciated directly but need to be extended.
    An action is something called when a condition becomes True
    Many action can be part of the same scenario, launched by the same Condition.
    An action gets 4 parameters:
        - A logger
        - The condition that is linked to the Action's instance,
        - The array of tests used in the condition.
        - A Hash of extra parameters that can be used to customize action
    Thus, it is possible to query any test independently to generate action based
    on some tests' value.
    The main method of this class is do_action(), that need to be extended by each Action class.
    It takes no argument and should return some hash. See method documentation for more details
    The process is :
        - When Scenario is created, both the condition and the list of actions are defined.
          Each Action will be instanciated at this time. An UUID will be return to UI to map this
          Action's instance
        - For each action, user might have to fill some parameters.
          When the parameters are filled, the do_init() is called
        - When Condition is evaluated to 'True', each action linked to it is called (do_action())
